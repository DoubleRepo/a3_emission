# Arma 3 Emission/Blowout Script [a3_emission]
A S.T.A.L.K.E.R. inspired blowout/emission script for use in Exile or custom Co-Op missions, this is derived work based on the original scripts for Arma 2: Namalsk Crisis made by Nightstalkers for the custom mission addons and DayZ: Epoch.
There have been major revisions and updates by Major Khunt and FallingSheep from the Exilemod.com forums to adapt the script so it is functional on Arma 3 and in particular, Exile servers.
